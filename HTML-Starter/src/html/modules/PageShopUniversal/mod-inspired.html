                                In 2005, engineer and founder Alain Clénet developed the first ergonomic adjustable bed base at his home in Santa Ynez, 
                                California. Having previously founded Clénet Coachworks, Inc. – a designer and manufacturer of limited-edition neoclassic 
                                automobiles – Clénet’s track record of creating luxury products was already well-established.
